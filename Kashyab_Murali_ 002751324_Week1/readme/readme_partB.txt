Concept: This is a 2-page small/medium business website. 

Page 1 contains 
1. Navigation bar 
    - It contains the logo, the options and a "join us" button that will lead to page 2.
2. Embedded video and description
    - Added a iframe video that shows the industries and the description is the practice followed by the company.
3. Footer section
    - Footer contains three sections: Policies, Navigation, and social media
Page 2 contains
1. Progress bar : It uses a Progress tag to show how much left is for someone to be a client.
2. A join us form : It uses a Form tags and labels tags to collect details about the clients.

Styling: External CSS : Most commonly used styling is margin, padding, borders, text-align, justify-contents

Tags used:

<html> ... </html> : It represents the root-level element under which all other child tags will be added.
<head> ... </head> :  It represents the header section where we add the link to external style, favicon(used for tab icon, bookmark icon), and the cdn used for icons.
<body> ... </body> : It represents the whole website section that contains the navigation bar, contents and the footer.
<div> ... </div> : One of the frequently used tags used to create containers that would make the formatting and styling efficient to do.
<footer> ... </footer> : Created footer with table tags to differentiate vertically.
<table> ... </table> and <form> ... </form>
<video> ...</video> : The video tag uses several attributes such as
    - controls: displays the play/pause button
    - autoplay: starts before we hit the play button
    - muted: stays muted unless did otherwise.
    - loop: plays in loop
HTML5 controls used: <article>, <footer>, <progress>, <video>, <source>, sliders
